# Webserv
This project provides me with the opportunity to engage in the development of my own **HTTP** server. The objective is to create a server that can be tested with a real browser, allowing me to gain practical experience with one of the most prevalent protocols on the internet. Acquiring a comprehensive understanding of HTTP is essential, as it proves beneficial even if my professional focus is not primarily on website development.

## Resources

### Server Setup
As we embark on the development of our HTTP server project in C++, a comprehensive understanding of socket programming is imperative. This skill will enable us to smoothly implement and enhance the communication channels within our server, ensuring effective and efficient operation. One of the greatest books about socket programming that help us to grasp this concept is [Hands On Network Programming with C](https://github.com/codeplea/Hands-On-Network-Programming-with-C).

### HTTP 1.1 (standard to follow)
This website, "[httpwg.org](https://httpwg.org/)" is wonderful as it gathers the RFCs of the HTTP protocol. It is a tremendous help for us in understanding the syntax of HTTP requests and responses.
